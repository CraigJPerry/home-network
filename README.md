## Home Network ##

This repository captures the configuration data to
automate buildout and management of my home network.


### How Does It Work? ###

1. Install the first node, see ``1.Bootstrap`` for how i've chosen to do
   this.
2. Use [Ansible](www.ansibleworks.com) to configure all hosts: backups;
   security; installed software etc. See ``2.Config``.
